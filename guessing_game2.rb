# Program: pick a random number between 1 and 100 and ask you for a guess.
# If guess < program's number --> puts "you were low; guess again."
# If guess > program's number --> puts "you were high; guess again."
# If guess == program's number --> puts "you are correct; you win!" & quit program.

# After 5 incorrect guesses, program says you lose.
# If you guess the same number twice, program asks if you're feeling all right (or something similarly sarcastic).
# All of your code should be inside of classes.
# This game should be run from the command line by typing ruby bin/guessing_game.rb.
